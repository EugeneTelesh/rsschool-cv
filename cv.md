Hi! I'm Eugene Telesh. 
I'm 39 years old. 
My contacts: sensorex@yandex.ru, sensormob22@gmail.com, linkedin.com/in/eugene-telesh-26885bbb/
I have a higher education as a teacher of geography. At the moment, I am receiving my second higher education as a computer science teacher. I work as a school teacher. I actively program in C#. I plan to completely change my field of activity and become a developer.
My wishes: Learn how to develop applications using plug-in external sensors, as well as the use of geolocation of devices working in a team, in order to solve practical problems. Simulation and programming of virtual reality for training.
